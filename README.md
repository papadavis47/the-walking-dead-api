# A REST API - for The Walking Dead on AMC

Fan project ðŸ¤“

I am building a REST API with the data coming from The Walking Dead Universe.

This is a project for me to use this custom API on my own test projects. I intend to use it heavily
to test various frontend React frameworks and projects.

I am using Node, Express and Mongo Atlas to store the data for now.

This is for my own consumption - but I will eventually open source it as I build it out further with
much more data - and as I learn more about API security.

It is REST for now as I build - but there will be a GraphQL version eventually ðŸ’¯
